# Product Vision and Strategy

## Product Overview

opnDossier is a specialized CLI tool designed for cybersecurity professionals to audit, analyze, and report on OPNsense firewall configurations. The tool transforms complex XML configuration files into structured, actionable reports for both defensive (blue team) and offensive (red team) security operations.

## Target Audience

### Primary Users

- **Security Auditors**: Professionals conducting compliance assessments and security reviews
- **Network Administrators**: Operations teams managing OPNsense deployments
- **Penetration Testers**: Red team professionals identifying attack surfaces and pivot points
- **Compliance Officers**: Teams ensuring adherence to security frameworks (STIG, SANS, CIS)

### Use Cases

- **Configuration Auditing**: Systematic review of firewall rules and security policies
- **Compliance Reporting**: Generate reports aligned with security frameworks
- **Security Assessment**: Identify misconfigurations and security gaps
- **Documentation Generation**: Create structured documentation from configuration files
- **Change Management**: Track and validate configuration changes over time

## Core Value Propositions

### For Blue Teams (Defensive)

- **Compliance Validation**: Automated checking against security standards
- **Configuration Clarity**: Transform complex XML into readable, actionable reports
- **Risk Assessment**: Identify security gaps and misconfigurations
- **Audit Trail**: Structured documentation for compliance and governance

### For Red Teams (Offensive)

- **Attack Surface Discovery**: Identify potential entry points and vulnerabilities
- **Pivot Point Analysis**: Map network segmentation and lateral movement opportunities
- **Target Prioritization**: Focus on high-value targets and weak configurations
- **Reconnaissance Automation**: Streamline information gathering from configurations

## Product Principles

### Operator-Focused Design

- Built by operators, for operators
- Intuitive workflows that match security professional mental models
- Minimal learning curve with maximum utility

### Offline-First Architecture

- No external dependencies or internet connectivity required
- Suitable for airgapped and high-security environments
- All processing happens locally with full data control

### Structured Data Philosophy

- Configuration data is structured, versioned, and portable
- Reports are machine-readable and human-friendly
- Data integrity and auditability are paramount

### Framework-First Approach

- Leverage established security frameworks and standards
- Avoid reinventing solutions where proven ones exist
- Extensible plugin architecture for custom compliance checks

## Competitive Differentiation

### Unique Strengths

- **OPNsense Specialization**: Deep understanding of OPNsense configuration structure
- **Dual Perspective**: Serves both defensive and offensive security needs
- **Offline Capability**: Works in restricted environments where other tools cannot
- **Compliance Integration**: Built-in support for major security frameworks
- **Extensible Architecture**: Plugin system for custom compliance rules

### Market Position

## Summary

### Coverage Statistics
- **Total Rule Items**: 89
- **Covered**: 45 (51%)
- **Partially Covered**: 1 (1%)
- **Missing**: 43 (48%)

### Major Missing Areas Requiring New Sections
1. **Audit Engine Architecture** - Complete audit engine implementation details
2. **Compliance Standards Framework** - STIG, SANS, and firewall compliance specifics
3. **Plugin Architecture** - Plugin development and management system
4. **Go Documentation Standards** - Comprehensive documentation requirements
5. **Advanced Testing Patterns** - Detailed testing methodologies beyond basics
6. **Performance and Optimization** - Performance considerations and best practices
7. **Container Development** - Container-specific development rules (may not be applicable)

### Recommended Actions
1. Add dedicated section for audit engine architecture and compliance standards
2. Expand testing section to include advanced patterns and methodologies
3. Add comprehensive documentation standards section
4. Consider adding performance optimization guidelines
5. Evaluate whether container-use rules are applicable to this project

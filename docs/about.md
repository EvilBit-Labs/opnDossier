# About OPNsense Configuration Processor

## Project Overview

The **OPNsense Configuration Processor** is a command-line tool designed to bridge the gap between complex XML configuration files and human-readable documentation. Built specifically for network operators and administrators working with OPNsense firewalls, this tool transforms cryptic XML configurations into clear, structured markdown documentation.

## Why This Tool Exists

Network administrators often need to:

- **Understand complex configurations** quickly during troubleshooting
- **Document network setups** for compliance and knowledge sharing
- **Review configuration changes** in a human-readable format
- **Work in offline environments** where web-based tools aren't available

Traditional approaches involve manually parsing XML files or using web-based converters that require internet connectivity. This tool solves these problems by providing a fast, offline, command-line solution.

## Core Principles

### Operator-Focused Design

Every feature is designed with the network operator in mind. Commands are intuitive, output is clear, and workflows match real-world operational needs.

### Offline-First Architecture

The tool functions completely offline, making it suitable for secure, airgapped environments where many network operations take place.

### Structured Data Philosophy

All output is structured, versioned, and portable, enabling automated processing and reliable documentation workflows.

### Framework-First Development

Rather than reinventing the wheel, the tool leverages established Go libraries and follows proven architectural patterns.

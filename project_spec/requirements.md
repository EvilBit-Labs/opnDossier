  - **F016**: Support audit report generation in three modes: standard (neutral documentation), blue (defensive analysis with findings and recommendations), and red (attack surface enumeration with optional blackhat commentary)
  - **F017**: Generate Markdown reports using Go text/template files from `internal/templates/reports/` with user-extensible sections for interfaces, firewall rules, NAT rules, DHCP, certificates, VPN config, static routes, and high availability
  - **F018**: Red team mode must highlight WAN-exposed services, weak NAT rules, admin portals, attack surfaces, and provide pivot data (hostnames, static leases, service ports) with optional blackhat commentary
  - **F019**: Blue team mode must include audit findings (insecure SNMP, allow-all rules, expired certs), structured configuration tables, and actionable recommendations with severity ratings
  - **F020**: Standard mode must produce detailed neutral configuration documentation including system metadata, rule counts, interfaces, certificates, DHCP, routes, and high availability
  - **F021**: Use consistent audit finding structure with Title, Severity, Description, Recommendation, Tags (Red mode adds AttackSurface, ExploitNotes)

- **User Stories and Use Cases**:

  - **Primary Workflow**: User obtains OPNsense config.xml file → runs `opnDossier convert config.xml` → system parses XML, converts to markdown, displays in terminal → user optionally exports to file
  - **Configuration Workflow**: User creates YAML config file with preferred settings → sets environment variables for sensitive options → runs commands with config automatically applied → overrides with CLI flags as needed
  - **Error Recovery Workflow**: System detects invalid XML → provides specific error message with line/column information → user corrects input file → re-runs command successfully
  - **Plugin Compliance Workflow**: User selects compliance plugins → system loads and validates plugins → runs compliance checks against configuration → generates comprehensive compliance report with findings and recommendations
